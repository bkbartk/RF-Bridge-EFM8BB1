This project is based on the portisch firmWare: https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1
But the code I copied from halfbackery: https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1/commit/97155e1cf77c4687c53d4e3c6dedac1821e8f8bd
Then I included this fix: https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1/commit/b741c75ba324a05ad46321789e7a821faf504850#diff-bfc6bf992497244b49a26db2f8a2fa8beeb3379406a1e7ac3f5285b854d2778d

The Sonoff RF Bridge is only supporting one protocol with 24 bits.<br/>
The Idea is to write a alternative firmware for the onboard EFM8BB1 chip.

Please take a look in the [wiki](https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1/wiki) for more information.
